# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project I coded an item-tracking program for a grocery store named Corner Grocer. This program would be used to track how often certain items are purchased.

# What did you do particularly well?
The core functionality of my program works well. The menu is neat and concise. In-line comments are thorough. Every task that was requested is in the code and works as expected.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by making it more adaptable to future changes. For example, if the sales for the next day included an item named 'Watermelon' my program would not be able to track any information for that item, as it was not included in the original sales information given. A decent amount of extra code would be necessary to add this one item. In the future I need to make my code more dynamic, reacting to the information given and acting accordingly, rather than being so static.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this code was getting started. By this I mean reading through the sales information, initializing the variables, and writing the necessary code to read information from the .txt file and output it to the .dat file. Simple Google searches, as well as previous zybooks lessons, helped me figure out some of the smaller details I was struggling with. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I feel that learning how to read data from a file, using that data throughout the program, and outputting further data to another file, are the most beneficial things I learned from this project.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program readable by seperating un-like sections with an empty line, keeping like sections together, and using sufficient in-line comments. I could have done a better job making this program adaptable, by making it better suited for future changes.
